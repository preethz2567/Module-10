# EX 01- Queue-Queue Values in Descending Order Using Python 

This Python program simulates a queue using a list, removes the first two elements (FIFO order), and displays the remaining values in descending order.

## Aim

To write a Python program to:
- Accept user inputs into a list (queue)
- Remove the first two elements (simulating dequeue)
- Display the remaining values in **descending order**

##  Algorithm

1. Create an empty list `q`.
2. Read an integer `n` to determine how many elements will be added.
3. Loop `n` times:
   - Read an input value.
   - Append it to the list `q`.
4. Remove the first element using `pop(0)`.
5. Remove the second element using `pop(0)` again.
6. Sort the list in descending order.
7. Print the updated list.

##  Program: 
```
q = []
n = int(input("Enter number of elements: "))
for i in range(n):
    val = int(input(f"Enter element {i+1}: "))
    q.append(val)

if len(q) >= 2:
    q.pop(0)
    q.pop(0)
elif len(q) == 1:
    q.pop(0)

q.sort(reverse=True)
print("Remaining elements in descending order:", q)
```

#  EX NO-03 Queue-Remove Two String Values from the Rear End in Python ðŸ§µ

This Python program demonstrates how to manage a list of strings and remove the last two elements (i.e., from the rear of the list).

##  Aim

To write a Python program to:
- Accept `n` string values from the user
- Remove the last two values (rear end of the list)
- Display the updated list

##  Algorithm

1. Create an empty list `q`.
2. Read an integer `n` from the user (number of strings).
3. Loop `n` times:
   - Read a string input.
   - Append it to the list `q`.
4. Remove the last element using `pop()`.
5. Remove the next last element using `pop()` again.
6. Display the updated list.

##  Program:
```
q = []
n = int(input("Enter number of strings: "))
for i in range(n):
    val = input(f"Enter string {i+1}: ")
    q.append(val)

if len(q) >= 2:
    q.pop()
    q.pop()
elif len(q) == 1:
    q.pop()

print("Updated list:", q)

```

#  EX 03-Stack Implementation Using `LifoQueue` (Max Size 7) 

This Python program demonstrates a stack implemented using the `LifoQueue` class from the `queue` module. It allows up to 7 elements, checks if the stack is full, and then prints the elements in reverse (LIFO) order.

##  Aim

To create a Python program that:
- Implements a stack using `LifoQueue` with a maximum size of 7
- Adds user-inputted values to the stack
- Checks whether the stack is full
- Prints the stack elements in reverse order (LIFO)

##  Algorithm

1. Import the `LifoQueue` class from the `queue` module.
2. Create a stack with a maximum size of 7.
3. Read the number of elements (`n`) to be added to the stack.
4. Loop `n` times:
   - Read a value from the user.
   - Use `put()` to push it onto the stack if it's not full.
5. Use `full()` to check if the stack is full and print the result.
6. Use `get()` repeatedly to pop and print elements in reverse order.

## Program
```
from queue import LifoQueue

stack = LifoQueue(maxsize=7)
n = int(input("Enter number of elements to push (max 7): "))

for i in range(n):
    if not stack.full():
        val = input(f"Enter value {i+1}: ")
        stack.put(val)
    else:
        print("Stack is full. Cannot push more elements.")
        break

print("Is the stack full?", stack.full())
print("Stack elements in LIFO order:")
while not stack.empty():
    print(stack.get())

```
